README

This network data is too large to upload but this folder contains 3 files, which are inputs to the {r5r} function that computes transit travel times.

The first two are GTFS format data on Muni and BART, respectively.

1. muni_gtfs.zip, which is downloaded from here: https://www.sfmta.com/reports/gtfs-transit-data
2. bart_gtfs.zip, which is downloaded from here: https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/gtfs

The third is a OpenStreetMap (osm) basemap.

3. sf.osm.pbf, which I download from here: https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/SanFrancisco/

Note that filenames and filetypes are important for compatibility with {r5r}.
